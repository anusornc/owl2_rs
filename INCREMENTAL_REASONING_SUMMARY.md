# Incremental Reasoning Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of incremental reasoning capabilities for the owl2_rs library. This feature enhances the reasoner to reuse previous reasoning results when the ontology is modified, potentially speeding up reasoning operations when only small changes have been made.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Change Tracking
- **ChangeTracker Struct**: Added to track ontology modifications
- **Revision Numbers**: Monotonic counter for ontology versions
- **Added/Removed Axioms**: Lists of axioms added or removed since last reasoning
- **Ontology Methods**: Helper methods to track changes (`add_axiom`, `remove_axiom`, `clear_changes`)

### 2. Incremental Reasoning Module
- **ReasoningResults Struct**: Stores results from previous reasoning operations
- **IncrementalReasoner Struct**: Wrapper that manages incremental reasoning
- **Reasoning Methods**: Implements both incremental and full reasoning approaches
- **Change Detection**: Logic to determine when incremental reasoning is beneficial

### 3. API Integration
- **Module Structure**: Clean separation of concerns in `incremental.rs`
- **Public Interface**: Well-defined public API for incremental reasoning
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing API remains unchanged

## Implementation Details

### Change Tracking System
The change tracking system monitors modifications to the ontology:

```rust
/// Tracks changes made to an ontology for incremental reasoning.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct ChangeTracker {
    /// The revision number of the ontology.
    pub revision: u64,
    /// Axioms that have been added since the last reasoning operation.
    pub added_axioms: Vec<Axiom>,
    /// Axioms that have been removed since the last reasoning operation.
    pub removed_axioms: Vec<Axiom>,
}
```

### Incremental Reasoning Engine
The incremental reasoning engine decides when to use previous results:

```rust
/// Results from a reasoning operation that can be reused for incremental reasoning.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ReasoningResults {
    /// The class hierarchy from the previous reasoning operation.
    pub class_hierarchy: ClassHierarchy,
    /// The individual types from the previous reasoning operation.
    pub individual_types: HashMap<Individual, IndividualTypes>,
    /// The consistency status from the previous reasoning operation.
    pub is_consistent: bool,
    /// The revision number of the ontology when these results were computed.
    pub revision: u64,
}

/// An incremental reasoner that can reuse previous reasoning results.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct IncrementalReasoner {
    /// The underlying tableau reasoner.
    tableau_reasoner: TableauReasoner,
    /// Previous reasoning results for incremental updates.
    previous_results: Option<ReasoningResults>,
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```rust
use owl2_rs::incremental::{IncrementalReasoner, ReasoningResults};

// Create an incremental reasoner
let ontology = Ontology::default();
let mut reasoner = IncrementalReasoner::new(ontology);

// Perform reasoning
let results = reasoner.reason_incremental();

// Modify the ontology
let mut ontology = reasoner.into_inner();
ontology.add_axiom(new_axiom);

// Create a new reasoner and perform incremental reasoning
let mut reasoner = IncrementalReasoner::new(ontology);
let new_results = reasoner.reason_incremental();
```

### Change Tracking
```rust
// Track changes to the ontology
let mut ontology = Ontology::default();
let class_a = Class(IRI("http://example.com/A".to_string()));
let class_b = Class(IRI("http://example.com/B".to_string()));
let axiom = Axiom::Class(ClassAxiom::SubClassOf {
    sub_class: ClassExpression::Class(class_a),
    super_class: ClassExpression::Class(class_b),
});

ontology.add_axiom(axiom);
// The change is automatically tracked in ontology.change_tracker
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Three new unit tests were added to verify the functionality:

1. **test_incremental_reasoner_creation**: Verifies creation of incremental reasoner
2. **test_reasoning_with_empty_ontology**: Tests reasoning with empty ontology
3. **test_ontology_change_tracking**: Tests change tracking functionality

All tests pass successfully.

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
The current implementation provides the framework for incremental reasoning but uses a simple heuristic:

```rust
fn can_do_incremental_reasoning(&self) -> bool {
    // Simple heuristic: if revision difference is small
    if let Some(ref previous) = self.previous_results {
        let current_revision = self.tableau_reasoner.ontology.change_tracker.revision;
        let previous_revision = previous.revision;
        current_revision - previous_revision < 10
    } else {
        false
    }
}
```

### Future Optimizations
Future work could include:

1. **Change Analysis**: Analyze specific changes to determine if incremental reasoning is beneficial
2. **Partial Updates**: Update only affected portions of reasoning results
3. **Caching Strategies**: Implement sophisticated caching with eviction policies
4. **Conflict Detection**: Detect when changes invalidate previous results

## Integration Status

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass (53/53)
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API
- ✅ Existing code continues to work unchanged

### New Functionality
- ✅ New incremental reasoning module added
- ✅ Change tracking integrated into Ontology struct
- ✅ 3 new unit tests added and passing
- ✅ Clean, well-documented public API
