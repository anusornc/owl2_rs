# owl2_rs - Clean Development Baseline

## Overview

This document establishes the clean development baseline for the owl2_rs library, providing a stable foundation for future enhancements.

## Current State

### ✅ Stable Foundation
- All 53 existing tests pass
- No compilation errors
- Clean, working codebase
- Well-documented API

### ✅ Core Features
1. **OWL 2 Parser**
   - Complete implementation of OWL 2 Functional-Style Syntax parser
   - Robust error handling
   - Comprehensive test coverage

2. **Tableau Reasoner**
   - Consistency checking (satisfiability)
   - Classification (subsumption relationships)
   - Realization (most specific types for individuals)
   - Instance checking

3. **API Layer**
   - Clean, easy-to-use public API
   - Well-documented functions with examples
   - Comprehensive test suite

4. **Test Infrastructure**
   - 53 unit tests covering all core functionality
   - Integration tests with real-world ontologies
   - Documentation tests ensuring examples work

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
1. **Main Branch**: Always stable, always compiles, always passes tests
2. **Feature Branches**: Create new branch from `main` for each feature
3. **Integration**: Merge feature branches back to `main` after thorough testing

### Development Process
1. Create feature branch from clean `main`
2. Implement feature with frequent testing
3. Ensure all existing tests still pass
4. Add new tests for new functionality
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Create pull request for review
7. Merge to `main` after approval

### Code Quality Standards
1. **Compilation**: No errors or warnings
2. **Testing**: All tests pass, new features covered
3. **Documentation**: Public APIs documented, examples provided
4. **Performance**: No significant performance regressions
5. **Compatibility**: Maintain backwards compatibility when possible

## Next Steps

### Short Term Goals
1. Implement incremental reasoning capabilities
2. Add explanation generation for inferences
3. Enhance error messages with more context
4. Add streaming APIs for large ontology processing

### Medium Term Goals
1. Add support for multiple RDF syntaxes (RDF/XML, Turtle, JSON-LD)
2. Implement caching mechanisms for performance
3. Add async/await support for better concurrency
4. Create SPARQL endpoint for querying ontologies

### Long Term Goals
1. Enable WebAssembly compilation for browser usage
2. Add support for SWRL rules
3. Implement statistical reasoning capabilities
4. Create full OWL 2 DL reasoner

## Dependencies

Current dependencies are minimal and focused:
- `pest` and `pest_derive` for parsing
- Standard Rust libraries for collections, I/O, etc.

## Performance Characteristics

The current implementation provides excellent performance:
- Consistency checking: Microseconds
- Classification: Milliseconds for moderate ontologies
- Realization: Milliseconds for moderate ontologies

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available:
- Inline API documentation with examples
- README with usage instructions
- Example programs in the `examples/` directory
- Test cases that serve as usage examples

This clean baseline provides an excellent foundation for implementing the enhancements outlined in the roadmap while maintaining the stability and reliability of the existing functionality.
