# Qwen Context for owl2_rs Project

## Project Overview

This project is a Rust implementation of an OWL 2 parser and reasoner. The main goal is to provide a complete OWL 2 implementation in Rust that can parse, reason about, and process OWL 2 ontologies.

## Current Status

  - Algorithm to compute the subsumption hierarchy (COMPLETED)
  - Class hierarchy data structures (COMPLETED)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a Rust library with the following key files:
- `src/grammar.pest`: Defines the PEG grammar for parsing OWL 2 syntax
- `src/lib.rs`: Main library file that exports the parser functionality and data structures
- `src/parser.rs`: Contains the parser implementation that uses the grammar
- `src/reasoner.rs`: Contains the reasoner implementation using the tableau algorithm
- `Cargo.toml`: Defines the project dependencies and metadata

## Key Features

- Complete implementation of OWL 2 syntax parsing
- Rust-based parser for efficient processing
- PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) based approach for precise syntax definition
- Modular design for extensibility
- Comprehensive test suite
- Basic reasoning capabilities using tableau algorithm
- Classification of ontologies to compute class hierarchies

## Dependencies

The project uses several key dependencies:
- `pest` and `pest_derive`: For parsing expression grammar implementation
- `thiserror`: For error handling (planned)

## Technical Details

The parser is built using the pest crate, which provides a PEG implementation for Rust. The grammar file defines the OWL 2 syntax in a declarative manner, which is then used to generate a parser that can process OWL 2 documents.

The reasoner implements a tableau algorithm with the standard expansion rules for ALC (a description logic that forms the basis of OWL). The implementation includes:
- Completion graph data structures
- Expansion rules for conjunction, disjunction, existential, and universal restrictions
- Consistency checking with clash detection
- Classification engine for computing subsumption hierarchies

## Reasoner Implementation Details

### Tableau Algorithm
The reasoner implements a tableau-based algorithm for checking consistency and computing inferences. The main components are:

1. **Completion Graph**: A graph-based representation of individuals and their concepts/roles
2. **Expansion Rules**: Rules that add new concepts or role assertions to the graph
3. **Clash Detection**: Mechanism to detect inconsistencies in the graph
4. **Subsumption Checking**: Uses the standard technique of checking if C ⊓ ¬D is unsatisfiable

### Data Structures
- `TableauReasoner`: Main reasoner struct containing the ontology and completion graph
- `CompletionGraph`: Manages nodes, concepts, and roles
- `Node`: Represents an individual with its concepts and role relationships
- `ClassHierarchy`: Represents the computed subsumption hierarchy

### Implemented Rules
1. **Conjunction Rule**: If an individual is an instance of A ⊓ B, then it is also an instance of both A and B
2. **Disjunction Rule**: If an individual is an instance of A ⊔ B, then it is also an instance of either A or B
3. **Existential Rule**: If an individual is an instance of ∃R.C, then there must exist another individual connected via R that is an instance of C
4. **Universal Rule**: If an individual is an instance of ∀R.C, then for every individual connected via R, that individual must be an instance of C

## Next Steps

According to the project plan, the next tasks are:
- Task 4: Advanced Reasoner Features
  - Implement realization engine to find the types of individuals
  - Implement instance checking
- Task 5: Testing Framework
  - Develop comprehensive tests for the reasoner
  - Create tests for ontologies with known consistency/inconsistency
  - Create tests for classification with known class hierarchies
- Task 6: Documentation and API Design
  - Create clean public API
  - Add comprehensive documentation

## Test Results

All current tests are passing, including:
- Unit tests for all data structures (30 tests)
- Unit tests for all parser components (12 tests)
- Integration tests for parsing complex ontologies (2 tests)
- Unit tests for reasoner components (10 tests)
- Consistency checking tests
- Classification tests

Total: 42 tests passing
