## Overview

The owl2_rs library is designed to be efficient for parsing and reasoning about OWL 2 ontologies. However, performance can vary significantly depending on the complexity and size of the ontologies being processed.

Understanding the performance characteristics of the library can help you optimize your usage and identify potential bottlenecks in your applications.

## Performance Characteristics

### Parsing Performance

The parsing performance is primarily affected by:

1. **Ontology Size**: Larger ontologies with more axioms take longer to parse
2. **Complexity**: Complex class expressions and nested constructs require more processing time
3. **IRI Resolution**: Parsing many unique IRIs can impact performance

Typical performance characteristics:
- Simple ontologies (10-100 axioms): < 100ms
- Medium ontologies (100-1000 axioms): 100ms - 1s
- Large ontologies (1000+ axioms): 1s - 10s+

### Reasoning Performance

The reasoning performance is primarily affected by:

1. **Ontology Consistency**: Inconsistent ontologies may be detected quickly or take longer depending on where the inconsistency occurs
2. **Class Hierarchy Complexity**: Ontologies with many classes and complex subsumption relationships take longer to classify
3. **Individual Count**: Ontologies with many individuals take longer to realize
4. **Expression Complexity**: Complex class expressions (nested intersections, unions, restrictions) increase reasoning time

Typical performance characteristics:
- Simple consistent ontologies: < 1s
- Medium complexity ontologies: 1s - 10s
- Complex ontologies: 10s - 100s+

## Profiling

To profile the performance of your application using owl2_rs, you can use standard Rust profiling tools:

### Using `cargo bench`

Create benchmark tests in the `benches/` directory:

```rust
// benches/parsing_benchmark.rs
use owl2_rs::parser::OWLParser;
use std::time::Instant;

fn bench_parsing() {
    let ontology_str = std::fs::read_to_string("test_cases/large_ontology.ofn").unwrap();
    
    let start = Instant::now();
    let _ontology = OWLParser::parse_ontology(&ontology_str).unwrap();
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    
    println!("Parsing took: {:?}", duration);
}
```

Run benchmarks with:

```bash
cargo bench
```

### Using External Profilers

You can also use external profilers like:

1. **perf** (Linux):
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   perf record ./target/release/your_program
   perf report
   ```

2. **Instruments** (macOS):
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   instruments -t "Time Profiler" ./target/release/your_program
   ```

3. **Visual Studio Profiler** (Windows)

## Optimization Tips

### For Parsing

1. **Batch Processing**: When parsing multiple ontologies, consider batching them to reduce startup overhead
2. **Reuse Parsers**: If parsing similar ontologies, consider reusing parser instances when possible
3. **Avoid Unnecessary Parsing**: Only parse ontologies when needed, and cache parsed results when possible

### For Reasoning

1. **Incremental Reasoning**: For ontologies that change incrementally, consider using incremental reasoning techniques
2. **Selective Reasoning**: Only perform the reasoning tasks you need (consistency checking, classification, realization)
3. **Preprocessing**: Simplify ontologies before reasoning when possible (removing redundant axioms, etc.)

### For Memory Usage

1. **Drop Unused Data**: Drop parsed ontologies and reasoner instances when they're no longer needed
2. **Streaming**: For very large ontologies, consider streaming parsing approaches
3. **Memory Profiling**: Use tools like `valgrind` or `heaptrack` to profile memory usage

## Memory Usage

The memory usage of owl2_rs depends on several factors:

### Parsing Memory Usage

- **IRI Storage**: Each unique IRI is stored as a String
- **Axiom Storage**: All axioms are stored in memory in the Ontology struct
- **Intermediate Data**: Parsing may create temporary data structures

### Reasoning Memory Usage

- **Completion Graph**: The completion graph can grow significantly for complex ontologies
- **Fresh Individuals**: The reasoner may create many fresh individuals during reasoning
- **Caching**: Some reasoners cache intermediate results to improve performance

### Memory Optimization Tips

1. **Drop Unused Ontologies**: Drop ontology instances when they're no longer needed
2. **Limit Concurrent Reasoners**: Running multiple reasoners concurrently increases memory usage
3. **Profile Memory Usage**: Use memory profiling tools to identify memory bottlenecks

## Scalability

### Large Ontologies

For very large ontologies (>10,000 axioms), consider:

1. **Streaming Parsing**: Implement streaming parsing to reduce memory usage
2. **Distributed Reasoning**: Split ontologies across multiple reasoners
3. **Approximate Reasoning**: Use approximate reasoning techniques for very large ontologies

### High-Concurrency Scenarios

For applications that need to process many ontologies concurrently:

1. **Thread Pooling**: Use thread pools to limit concurrent processing
2. **Resource Limits**: Set memory and CPU limits for each processing task
3. **Caching**: Cache parsed ontologies and reasoning results when possible

### Performance Monitoring

In production environments, consider monitoring:

1. **Parsing Time**: Track how long it takes to parse ontologies
2. **Reasoning Time**: Track how long reasoning tasks take
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage to detect leaks or excessive usage
4. **Error Rates**: Track parsing and reasoning errors

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Caching**: Cache parsed ontologies and reasoning results
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async/await for non-blocking processing
3. **Parallel Processing**: Use multiple threads for independent ontologies
4. **Resource Management**: Properly manage resources to avoid leaks

By following these guidelines and monitoring performance, you can optimize your usage of the owl2_rs library for your specific use cases.
